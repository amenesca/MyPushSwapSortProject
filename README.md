# MyPushSwapSortProject

This is a sort programm made in C, with operations made in stacks.<br><br>
it's objective is to count how much operations is needed to sort a sequence<br>
depending on wich sort algorithm the code is using, I made using radix sort.<br><br>

Usage:<br>
compile using make.<br><br>
&gt; ./push_swap 4 29 18 5 1<br>
ra<br>
pb<br>
pb<br>
ra<br>
pa<br>
ra<br>
pa<br>
ra<br>

The output is the operations realized.<br>
you can count with ./push_swap 4 29 18 5 1 84 | wc -l<br>
that should be 8
